This is a database that I created so that I could practice different database concepts.

Concepts include:
  Creating relationships between tables through Primary (and Foreign) Keys
  Editing tables (names, data types, etc.)
    I did most of the editing myself, but sometimes, for more complex functions, I used MySQL Workbench.
